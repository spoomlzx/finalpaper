\subsection{单向hash链}
A hash function takes a binary string of arbitrary
length as input, and outputs a binary string of fixed
length. A one-way hash function H satisfies the
following three properties: (1) given an input x, it is
easy to compute y such that y=H(x); (2) given a hash
value y, it is computationally infeasible to find a second
input x such that y=H(x);(3) Given a hash value y, it is
computationally infeasible to find a second input x’
such thatH(x’) = y, where x x’.
对一个任意大小的消息，hash函数能输出一个给定长度的消息摘要，可以表示为$hash:\{0,1\}^*\rightarrow\{0,1\}^i$

A one-way hash chain is a sequence of hash values
{x0, x1, …, xn-1, xn} such that {xj|∀j: 0<j≤n, xj-1=H(xj)}.
It can be derived as follows: (1) Generating a random
secret seed xn; (2) repeatedly applying the same one
way hash function on the seed xn to produce the hash
chain. Thus, there exists the following relation:
x0=H(x1) =H2(x2) = … = Hn-1(xn-1) = Hn (xn). Due to the
one-way hash chain property, given xi, it is
computationally infeasible to calculate xj (j>i), but is
easy to compute any xj (j<i) with xj = Hi-j(xi).
